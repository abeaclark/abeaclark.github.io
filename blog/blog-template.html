<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  For this project it was relatively easy because we were aligned in our thinking for how the page would be layed out. I think that if it was a more open assignment, it would be tougher to collaborate via webcam. We were using paper/pencil, but I suppose if you used an online program, collaboration would be easier. We also decided that the format we used for the intitial blog post last week was what we wanted for our next blog posts, so we focused on the main blog landing page instead for this assignment. I have gone back and done it for the individual post after seeing the solo challenge.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing was helpful because you new what elements you needed, in what order. Without it, I think it would have been easy to get lost in the code too early.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We decided that getting the format down is important. We also talked through which semantic tags we would use for which elements. We didn't talk about sizing because we are not supposed to worry about that yet, but I think that would be important at the wireframe stage as well.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I learned about the figcaption tag which is used to put accompanying text to figures.
