What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
>I learned a lot by hard knocks. It really is a process of experimenting and seeing how the layout responds as you tweak things. I learned that having specific classes is vital because at first I was formatting general things like <nav> <header>, etc. but then when I wanted to re-use the code on the other pages of the blog, it made it very hard.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
>I learned that it will take more practice for me to get it down. I am becoming more familiar with how the display and positioning properties work, but sometimes things don't turn out as I expected.


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
>The most easy to implement were columns using the <ul> element. This is because you can just specify a width of ~45% and it ends up splitting them into two columns.

>The most difficult has been the positioning and learning how to use fixed, absoulte, etc. and how it relates to the "float" attribute.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
>I learned to have careful class structure. I also learned that it is AMAZING when you can re-use code, so I am going to try to think in that way going forward.
